# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
As we get close to finishing another year here at Pewlett Hackard, my colleague Bobby and I have been assigned to put together a report that displays information about our employees who may be retiring soon. Our purpose to this analysis is find out who all is retiring and what their title is and then determine who all would be eligible for our new mentorship program!

## Results

- Here at Pewlett Hackard, we have a total of 300,024 employees. Out of all of them, we have a total of 90,398 that have the option to retire. That is almost 1/3rd of the entire company! With so many people retiring, we need to make sure we have the right people in place to take over those positions. On top of this, we need a healthy amount of applicants to interview so they can fill any vacancies.

- Of those that are retiring, we see the roles that are going to have the highest employee shortages being the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions. With almost 30,000 employees from each role retiring respectively.

## Summary
From our results, we can determine that there will roughly be 90,000 roles that will need to be filled. Currently, we have 1,549 employees that can step in to a mentorship role and help train the next generation in these roles. As you can see below, the amount of mentors per role is very limited. When we take a look back and see how many people are retiring from each role. We can see that the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles are going to see the largest vacancies within the company. When it comes to mentoring new prospects for these roles, our Senior Engineer mentors will be spread thin; for each Senior Engineer mentor, there will be roughly 174 trainees under them. Now, the Senior Staff has it a little better, with 50 trainees per mentor respectively. All in all, Pewlett-Hackard does not have enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation and give them the training that they deserve. Pewlett-Hackard should look elsewhere to acquire additional mentors or develop a virtual mentorship program made by the current mentors and designed to train thousands of employees at the same time.
